Stew Detective is a simple mod that adds a tooltip to suspicious stews that shows you the effects it has and their durations.

This may be considered a cheat on some servers - so do get permission before using it on multiplayer servers.

### Held Item Info
There is an optional integration with the mod [Held Item Info](https://modrinth.com/mod/held-item-info) by [A5b84](https://modrinth.com/user/A5b84).
It can be toggled within HII's config.
